# Determining for the ranges can be both playing ability of the performer or
# difference between so called professional and amateur instrument versions.
#
#              NOTES: If there is no difference for amateur/professional, use
#              the same pitches for both.  If no range limitation is desired
#              for some reason, use a low of 0 and a high of 127, rather than
#              letter pitches.  Otherwise use letter + sharp + octave such as
#              G5 F#3.  (All pitches ultimately get converted to numbers, so
#              these explict 0/127 are effectively pre-converted.)
#
#              Most chromatic alterations should be spelled with sharps
