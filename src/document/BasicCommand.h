/// A command with undo/redo functionality.
/**
 * Derivers provide their own version of modifySegment() which does the
 * actual work of the command.  This class takes care of undo/redo.
 *
 * This class stores the entirety of the original version of the Segment
 * in m_originalEvents.
 *
 * On undo (unexecute()), this class only copies back the events in the
 * range of time that was modified.  This is done primarily because the
 * UI refresh code is terribly inefficient and refreshes the entire UI for
 * each and every Event that gets added to a Segment.
 *
 * The times passed to the constructor are no longer used to determine
 * the range of events to copy. This is now determined by
 * calculateModifiedStartEnd(). The getStartTime() and getEndTime() methods
 * are used as a store for the times provided in the constructors. The
 * use of these methods is deprecated. It is only necessary for the
 * derivers to override modifySegment().
 *
 * "Brute force redo" means redo by copying a list of Events instead of calling
 * modifySegment() to perform the command again.  Brute force redo requires
 * more memory, but is more reliable.
 *
 * BasicCommand is an abstract subclass of NamedCommand that manages undo,
 * redo and notification of changes(?) within a contiguous region of a
 * single Rosegarden Segment, by brute force(?).  When a subclass
 * of BasicCommand executes, it stores a copy of the events that are
 * modified by the command, ready to be restored verbatim on undo.
 *
 * TODO
 * - Remove the deprecated member functions and variables.
