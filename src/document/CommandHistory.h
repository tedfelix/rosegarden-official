 * The CommandHistory class stores a list of executed

 * and Redo menu or toolbar with the same command history, and it
 * keeps them all up-to-date at once.  This makes it effective in
 * systems where multiple views may be editing the same data.

 *     be destroyed when the current document is destroyed, and it
 *     can be ignored when a temporary document is created.  As a
 *     global Singleton this is too confusing.
