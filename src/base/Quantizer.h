     * \arg source, target : Description of where to find the

     *
     * These may be strings, specifying a prefix for the names
     * of properties to contain the timings, or may be the special
     * value RawEventData in which case the event's absolute time
     * and duration will be used instead of properties.
     *
     * If source specifies a property prefix for properties that are
     * found not to exist, they will be pre-filled from the original
     * timings in the target values before being quantized and then
     * set back into the target.  (This permits a quantizer to write
     * directly into the Event's absolute time and duration without
     * losing the original values, because they are backed up
     * automatically into the source properties.)
     *
     * Note that because it's impossible to modify the duration or
     * absolute time of an event after construction, if target is
     * RawEventData the quantizer must re-construct each event in
     * order to adjust its timings.  This operation (deliberately)
     * loses any non-persistent properties in the events.  This
     * does not happen if target is a property prefix.
     *
     *   Examples:
     *
     *   -- if source == RawEventData and target == "MyPrefix",
     *   values will be read from the event's absolute time and
     *   duration, quantized, and written into MyPrefixAbsoluteTime
     *   and MyPrefixDuration properties on the event.  A call to
     *   unquantize will simply delete these properties.
     *
     *   -- if source == "MyPrefix" and target == RawEventData,
     *   the MyPrefixAbsoluteTime and MyPrefixDuration will be
     *   populated if necessary from the event's absolute time and
     *   duration, and then quantized and written back into the
     *   event's values.  A call to unquantize will write the
     *   MyPrefix-property timings back into the event's values,
     *   and delete the MyPrefix properties.
     *
     *   -- if source == "YourPrefix" and target == "MyPrefix",
     *   values will be read from YourPrefixAbsoluteTime and
     *   YourPrefixDuration, quantized, and written into the
     *   MyPrefix-properties.  This may be useful for piggybacking
     *   onto another quantizer's output.
     *
     *   -- if source == RawEventData and target == RawEventData,
     *   values will be read from the event's absolute time and
     *   duration, quantized, and written back to these values.
