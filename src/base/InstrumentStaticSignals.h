     *
     * Emit this if you change the value for a control change for
     * an Instrument.  This will trigger an update of relevant portions
     * of the UI (sliders and knobs) to reflect the new values.  This
     * will also trigger RosegardenSequencer to send out appropriate
     * control change messages via MIDI or update the level and pan
     * settings for audio instruments.
     *
     * Handlers should update only that part of the
     * UI that displays this specific control change value.
     *
     * This is used for control change notifications which can happen
     * very quickly as the user moves volume sliders, pan knobs, and
     * other control change knobs.
     *
     * By separating these out from the other more general update
     * notifications (e.g. RD::documentModified()), we can avoid updating
     * too much of the UI when these come in.  This should improve
     * performance.
     *
     * Note that this only applies to the initial control change
     * on a Track.  This has nothing to do with any control changes
     * that may appear on the rulers as the Composition progresses.
