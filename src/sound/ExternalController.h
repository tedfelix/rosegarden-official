/// Support for the "external controller" port.
/**
 * The external controller port allows MIDI control surfaces to control
 * the main window, MIDI Mixer window, and Audio Mixer window.
 *
 * To use, be sure to enable the external controller port in the preferences:
 *
 *   Edit > Preferences... > MIDI > General tab > External controller port
 *   checkbox.
 *
 * After a restart of Rosegarden, an "external controller" port will
 * appear for MIDI control surfaces to connect to.
 *
 * The current window can be selected via CC81.  See processEvent().
 *
 * Depending on the current active window, the behavior of the external
 * controller port will change.  For the main window, the following features
 * are available via control changes on *channel 1*:
 *
 *   CC 82: select Track
 *   CC  7: Adjust volume on current Track
 *   CC 10: Adjust pan on current track
 *   CC  x: Adjust that CC on current track
 *
 * See RosegardenMainViewWidget::slotExternalController() for details.
 *
 * For the MIDI Mixer window and Audio Mixer window, CCs can be sent on
 * any of the 16 channels to control those channels on the mixer.  See
 * MidiMixerWindow::slotExternalController() and
 * AudioMixerWindow2::slotExternalController() for details.
 *
 * CCs are also sent out the external controller port to allow motorized
 * control surfaces to stay in sync with the current state of the CCs.
