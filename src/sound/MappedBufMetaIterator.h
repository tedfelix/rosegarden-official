/**
 * MappedBufMetaIterator.  What's in a name?  "MappedBuf" refers to
 * the MappedEventBuffer-derived classes that this class takes as input
 * (see addBuffer()).  The most important MappedEventBuffer-derived class is
 * InternalSegmentMapper.  "MetaIterator" describes the main function of this
 * class.  It is an iterator that coordinates other iterators.  Specifically,
 * MappedEventBuffer::iterator objects.  fillCompositionWithEventsUntil()
 * gets events from all the various MappedEventBuffer-derived objects
 * that are connected and (typically) combines them together into a single
 * MappedEventList via a MappedEventInserter.  A better name for this class
 * might be MappedEventBufferMixer (or Combiner).
 *
 * An instance of this class is owned by RosegardenSequencer and used
 * for playback of the Composition.
 *
 * An instance of this class is created by MidiFile and used for exporting
 * standard MIDI files.
 *
 * This is the second part of a two-part process to convert the Event objects
 * in a Composition into MappedEvent objects that can be sent to ALSA.  For
 * the first part of this conversion, see InternalSegmentMapper.
