/**
 * Trivial class to suck the patch map out of a .sf2 SoundFont file.
 * Inspired by (but not based on) sftovkb by Takashi Iwai.
 * 
 * SoundFont is a straightforward RIFF format so there's some
 * redundancy between this and RIFFAudioFile -- we don't take any
 * advantage of that, and this class is completely self-contained.
 *
 * Tolerates garbled files; will just suck all it can rather than
 * throw an error, except if the file is not a SoundFont at all.
