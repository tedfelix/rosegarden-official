 * This is used at startup to log information that could be helpful for
 * diagnosing certain problems related to audio and MIDI.  The contents
 * of this log can be examined by the user via the preferences dialog.
 * Edit > Preferences... > General tab > Details... button.
 *
 * In the past, this class also dumped the logging to RG_DEBUG.  This
 * way one only needed to log to Audit and the logging would also end
 * up in the debug output.  The problem with this is that Audit delays
 * logging to RG_DEBUG until the Audit object is destroyed.  This means
 * that when there is a crash, logging it lost.
 *
 * Now, if you want logging to RG_DEBUG/RG_WARNING and Audit, you have
 * to explicitly use both.  E.g.:
 *
 *   AUDIT << "AlsaDriver::initialiseMidi(): initialised MIDI subsystem\n";
 *   RG_DEBUG << "initialiseMidi(): initialised MIDI subsystem";
 *
 * It's redundant, but there's no easy way around this.
