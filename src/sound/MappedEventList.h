 * Note that MappedEventList is a list of MappedEvents, not a mapped
 * list of events.  Although a MappedEvent is a fixed-size object for
 * use in contexts like MappedEventBuffer which contain fixed-size sets of
 * fixed-size objects to be read and written with minimal locking,
 * MappedEventList is a normal container with nothing fixed about it;
 * it's just the container that happens to be used in sequencer
 * threads when a set of MappedEvents is called for.
