/// Converts (maps) Event objects into MappedEvent objects for a Segment
/**
 * @author Tom Breton (Tehom)
 *
 * InternalSegmentMapper.  What's in a name?  "Internal" qualifies a
 * Segment as containing Rosegarden's internal representation of MIDI
 * notes etc, as opposed to an audio segment.  The term "Mapper" is
 * used largely for historical reasons, but can be understood as
 * mapping (converting) Event objects from a Segment into MappedEvent
 * objects which are ready for playback.  The key mapping routine is
 * InternalSegmentMapper::fillBuffer().
 *
 * This class might be better named MappedMIDISegment as that is what it is
 * rather than what it does.  It's a more "O-O" name, which in this case feels
 * better.  Of course, the base class and other related classes would need
 * to adopt similar names.  The entire MappedEventBuffer hierarchy probably
 * needs to be examined to see if there are opportunities for simplification
 * and renaming for increased clarity.
 *
 * This is the first part of a two-part process to convert the Event objects
 * in a Composition into MappedEvent objects that can be sent to ALSA.  For
 * the second part of this conversion, see MappedBufMetaIterator.
