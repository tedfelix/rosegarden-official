/// Owns and services a ChannelInterval for an Instrument.
/**
 * ChannelManager's purpose is to own and service a ChannelInterval
 * (ChannelManager::m_channelInterval) relative to an Instrument that wants to
 * play on it.
 *
 * There is one ChannelManager for each MIDI Segment.  It is owned by the
 * InternalSegmentMapper for that Segment.  See CompositionMapper which
 * holds the InternalSegmentMapper instances for each Segment.
 *
 * ChannelManager objects are also owned by MetronomeMapper and
 * StudioControl (for preview notes, etc.).
 *
 * makeReady() is probably the main function here.  It allocates a channel
 * and inserts a channel setup into a MappedEventList via an inserter.
 *
 * insertEvent() is probably the most called function here.  It is used by
 * InternalSegmentMapper to insert all of the events from a Segment.
 *
 * Special cases it deals with:
 *
 *   - Eternal channels, e.g. for the metronome.  Call setEternalInterval()
 *     to make a channel interval that's guaranteed to be longer than the
 *     composition.
 *
 *   - Fixed channels, for which it doesn't use a channel allocator
 *     (AllocateChannels), but pretends to be doing all the same stuff.
 *
 * ChannelManager adapts to changes to the instrument, so it may become
 * fixed/unfixed and ready/unready as the instrument is changed.
 *
 * One way in which it services channels is by providing setup events (bank &
 * program, etc).  The note-producing source
 * calls it with an inserter, and ChannelManager puts the respective events
 * into the inserter and then (trusting the note-producing source to insert
 * those events) flags itself ready.
