    // Because the only ProgressBar doing anything is the one in the main window

    // the bloody hell would we want to change the function of the CPU meter
    // anyway?  Now that I think back on it, it used to get stuck in odd places
    // anyway.  So if I disentangle those two things from each other and make
    // them separate, that's part of the battle won.

    // Or so I'm thinking.
