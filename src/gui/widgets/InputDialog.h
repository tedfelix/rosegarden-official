/**This class provides an API-compatible drop-in replacement for
 * certain QInputDialog methods that stubbornly resisted styling any other way.
 *
 * The normal styling process has involved painting broad "widgetless" areas
 * with QWidget hacks.  These are necessary to paint certain void areas in the
 * main window background and in various other places that don't belong to
 * anything that can be addressed via a QSS selector.  These QWidget hacks
 * affect all child widgets, but it is normally possible to override the
 * background with highly specific selectors.  Not so for QInputDialog, it turns
 * out.  The only way to control its background after a QWidget hack upstream is
 * to use a local stylesheet directly in the code.
 *
 * This phenomenon affects us in two important ways.  Most critically, we have
 * had to resort to replacing QLineEdit with our own Rosegarden::LineEdit
 * subclass in order to allow for styling the text background, and we need a way
 * to use our own LineEdit inside these dialogs.  Less critically, but still
 * annoying, all these random, simple dialogs want to take their backgrounds
 * from whatever widget they launched off of, and this means we have a sea of
 * little superficial dialogs taking any of about three different backgrounds
 * unpredictably.  Afer much unsuccessful stumbling about, I elected to
 * re-implement part of QInputDialog's functionality in order for us to have a
 * place to solve these problems with local stylesheet hacks.  Local stylesheets
 * are the most specific selector of all, and trump anything that can be
 * achieved through any kind of external stylesheet.
