     * MatrixWidget connects the piano view's wheelEventReceived() signal to
     * the matrix view's slotEmulateWheelEvent() slot.  This ensures that the
     * matrix view stays in sync with the piano view.

     * ??? Since we already have a viewportChanged() signal, why not also
     *     offer a slotSyncVertical() that can handle that signal and keep
     *     two views in sync vertically (position and zoom)?  That would
     *     eliminate the need for the wheelEventReceived() signal.  This
     *     would also fix the bug where using the scroll wheel with Shift

     *     end up out of sync with the piano view.

     * signal to the notation view's slotEmulateWheelEvent() slot.  This
     * ensures that the notation view stays in sync with the track headers
     * view.

     *     signal and instead connect the track headers view's
     *     viewportChanged() to a new slotSyncVertical() in the
     *     notation view.  That should be simpler and fix some bugs.
