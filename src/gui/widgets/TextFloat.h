/**

  A TextFloat is a box containing some text which can be displayed anywhere
  above the application windows, not necessarily above its parent widget.

  TextFloat implements it as a BaseTextFloat singleton shared by all widgets
  needing it.

  Currently Rosegarden uses text float to clarify some mouse actions.
  As long as usual systems only have one mouse cursor TextFloat may be used
  in place of BaseTextFloat.

  To use a TextFloat :

    1 - Always get the TextFloat instance address using getTextFloat()
        and never store it in a member variable.

    2 - Call attach() to pass its current parent widget to TextFloat
        (Typically this should be done in parent enterEvent() method)

    3 - Call setText() to define which text to display

    4 - Call display() to move and show the text float

    5 - Repeatedly call setText() to change the text and/or call display()
        to move the text float

    6 - call hide() or hideAfterDelay() to hide the text float

  There should be no need to call reparent() explicitly as attach() does it to
  be called when necessary.


  Note : If some parent of the widget using a text float is destroyed, Qt4 will
         try to destroy all its childs among which is the text float.
         In a first implementation, as TextFloat is a singleton, its dtor was
         protected and the destroy attempt lead to a RG crash.
         In current implementation TextFloat dtor is public and Qt4 may destroy
         the singleton. But there should be no harm provided the widgets using
         TextFloat never store (then use) a pointer to it among their members.
         A new instance should be recreated as soon as TextFloat::getTextFloat()
         will be called again.

  Warning : To call TextFloat::getTextFloat() is now mandatory in all methods
            needing a pointer to the TextFloat instance.
