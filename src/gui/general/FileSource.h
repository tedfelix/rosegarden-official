/**
 * FileSource is a class used to refer to the contents of a file that
 * may be either local or at a remote location such as a HTTP URL.
 *
 * When a FileSource object is constructed, the file or URL passed to
 * its constructor is tested for validity, and if it refers to a
 * remote HTTP or FTP location it is retrieved asynchronously (the Qt
 * event loop must be running) and cached locally.  You can then query
 * a local path for the file and refer to that as a normal filename.
 *
 * Use isAvailable() to test whether the file or remote URL exists,
 * and isOK() to test for internal validity or transmission errors.
 * Call waitForStatus() to block until the availability and validity
 * of the URL have been established so that isAvailable may be called,
 * and waitForData() to block until the entire file has been cached.
 *
 * FileSource handles reference counting for cache files.  You can
 * construct many FileSource objects with the same URL and you will
 * receive the same cached file for each; it is also reasonable to
 * pass FileSource objects by value.  FileSource only makes sense for
 * stateless URLs that result in the same data on each request.
 *
 * Cached files share a lifetime with their "owning" FileSource
 * objects; when the last FileSource referring to a given URL is
 * deleted or goes out of scope, its cached file (if any) is also
 * removed.
