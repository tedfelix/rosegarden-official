/** Implement functionality equivalent to the old external
 *  rosegarden-lilypondview script.  The script used the external dcop and
 *  kdialog command line utlities to provide a user interface.  We'll do the
 *  user interface in real code, though we still have to use external helper
 *  applications to print, display a PDF, and of course it's all for naught
 *  without LilyPond itself being available.
 *
 *  I suppose we'll make the Conftest target just handle the "install some
 *  stuff" warnings inside itself, and I'll eliminate the redudant warnings
 *  elsewhere when I run across them.  We won't need a non-graphical mode for
 *  this, since it will always be running out of the GUI.  Other side benefits,
 *  this means it runs with the same stylesheet as the rest of Rosegarden super
 *  cheap.

    /** The old command line arguments are replaced with an int passed into the
     * ctor, using the following named constants to replace them, and avoid a
     * bunch of string parsing nonsense.  We no longer need a startup ConfTest
     * target.  We'll do the conftest every time we run instead, and only
     * complain if there is a problem.  We no longer need a version target,
     * since the version is tied to Rosegarden itself.  That means we really
     * only need a PDF preview mode and a direct print mode.
     *
     * The filename parameter should be a temporary file set elsewhere and
     * passed in.  Unfortunately, there was a bit of a snag with that.  The
     * QProcess bits choke when start() is called with a filename that has an
     * absolute path in it, but the code in RosegardenMainWindow needs to have
     * an absolute path where the file is going to reside in order for
     * QTemporaryFile to ensure a safe, non-duplicate filename is created, so we
     * have to pass the absolute path in and then strip it back out inside here,
     * using QProcess::setWorkingDirectory() instead.  (This is pretty ugly, but
     * I'm stumped coming up with a cleaner solution, so damn the torpedoes.)
