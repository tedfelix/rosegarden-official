/**
 * The TrackButtons class is a QFrame that runs vertically along the left
 * side of the tracks (CompositionView).  It contains an "HBox" QFrame for
 * each track.  That HBox contains the widgets that appear to the left of
 * each track:
 *
 *   - The TrackVUMeter (which doubles as the track number)
 *   - The Mute LedButton
 *   - The Record LedButton
 *   - The TrackLabel (defaults to "<untitled>")
 *
 * These widgets are created based on the RosegardenDocument.
 *
 * TrackEditor owns the single instance of this class.  See
 * TrackEditor::m_trackButtons.
 *
 * Suggestion: This class appears to be the focus for track related changes.
 * It would probably be better to have the system make direct changes to
 * Composition, then call a notification routine which would trigger an
 * update to this UI.  This should result in simpler code.
