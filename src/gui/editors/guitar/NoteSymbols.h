/**
 *----------------------------------------
 * Finding X position on guitar chord pixmap
 *----------------------------------------
 *
 * Originally x = position * scale + FC::BORDER + FC::CIRCBORD + FC::FRETTEXT
 *
 * The last three can be condense into on term called XBorder
 *      XBorder = FC::BORDER + FC::CIRCBORD + FC::FRETTEXT
 *             = 5 + 2 + 10 (see fingers.h)
 *             = 17
 *
 * The drawable guitar chord space on the x-axis:
 *      XGuitarChord = pixmap width - XBorder
 *                = width - 17
 *
 * The guitar chord x-axis is broken up into colums which represent the drawable
 * space for a guitar chord component (e.g. note, barre)
 *      Column Width = XGuitarChord / number of strings
 *
 * Therefore a new x can be calculated from the position and the column width
 *      x = (position * Column Width) + XBorder
 *
 *-------------------------------------------
 * Finding Y position on guitar chord pixmap
 *-------------------------------------------
 *
 * Originally y = (FC::BORDER * scale) + (2 * FC::SPACER) + (fret * scale) + FC::CIRCBORD
 *
 * As with the x-axis the equation can be separated into the position plus the border. In
 * this case YBorder
 *      YBorder = (FC::BORDER*scale) + (2*FC::SPACER) + FC::CIRCBORD
 *              = 17 (If we want to use the same border as the x-axis)
 *
 * The drawable guitar chord space on the y-axis:
 *      YGuitarChord = pixmap height - YBorder
 *
 * The guitar chord y-axis is broken up into rows which represent the drawable
 * space for a guitar chord component (e.g. note, barre)
 *      Row Height = YGuitarChord / number of frets
 *
 * Therefore a new y can be calculated from the fret position and the row height
 *      y = fret * Row Height
