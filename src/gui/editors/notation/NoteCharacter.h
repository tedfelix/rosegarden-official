/**
 * NoteCharacter knows how to draw a character from a font.  It may be
 * optimised for screen (using QPixmap underneath to produce
 * low-resolution colour or greyscale glyphs) or printer (using some
 * internal representation to draw in high-resolution monochrome on a
 * print device).  You can use screen characters on a printer and vice
 * versa, but the performance and quality might not be as good.
 *
 * NoteCharacter objects are always constructed by the NoteFont, never
