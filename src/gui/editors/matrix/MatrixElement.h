 * This is more of a "MatrixNoteView" in pattern-speak or a "MatrixNoteItem"
 * in Qt-speak.
 *
 * m_item is the QGraphicsRectItem (or QGraphicsPolygonItem) that is
 * displayed for a note on the matrix.  reconfigure() creates m_item and
 * adds it to the scene.  m_item is owned by this class.
 *
 * MatrixElements (and ViewElements in general) are stored in
 * ViewSegment::m_viewElementList.  They are created in
 * MatrixViewSegment::makeViewElement().
